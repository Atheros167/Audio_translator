# Audio_translator

This is work in progress and as such is a bare bone code. This code does the following

1. Listen to a sentence spoken (in english)
2. Creates a list of the spoken words
3. Translates to another language like French and creates a list of it.

TODO:
* Convert the french list to audio file
* Add compatibility with other spoken languages in first step. Currently recognizes only English
* Improve time efficiency.
